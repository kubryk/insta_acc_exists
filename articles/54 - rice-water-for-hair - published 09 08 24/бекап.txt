<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>What Is Rice Water</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rice water for hair is a hair treatment, used by women centuries ago, that is in fact just some starchy water left after rice is cooked, or it can also be the water in which rice has been soaked for a while.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rice contains Vitamins B1 and B6, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Selenium, Manganese, and a lot of other components. The composition of rice water is rich in <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/vitamins-for-hair-growth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vitamins</a> too, especially B and C. It also contains trace elements – potassium, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, manganese, and a lot of fiber.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We need to mention the inositol here too, as it is a substance that is used to treat different medical conditions and believed to balance women's hormones, which can help in reversing <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/hairstyles-for-thin-hair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thinning hair</a>. You may not only take inositol supplements but also feed your hair with it from the outside.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, rice water is a real treasure trove of nutrients that nourish the follicles and repair damaged cells.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Rice Water Benefits for Hair</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What does rice water do for your hair? The main benefits of rice water for locks are: creating a better scalp environment, helping in strengthening the hair cuticle, <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/how-to-get-shiny-hair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">boosting the hair shine</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The available researches are not full enough to make us 100% sure that rice water is ALWAYS a cure and that it will 100% help you with hair growth. It is even said that the protein in rice water is too large to penetrate the strands and it only coats them and prevents them from drying out. So, it is the 'length retention', not the growth in fact. However, the results of women with different hair types who have tried rice water for their hair are quite eloquent.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Rice Water Recipes: How to Make Soaked, Boiled, and Fermented Rice Water</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How to make rice water for hair at home? There are 3 most popular and effective ways to make rice water for hair. You can try all of them and choose the one you like the most. Basically, you’ll need only two ingredients!</p>
 
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>-Soaked rice water for hair recipe.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To make soaked rice water for your hair, you will need to follow these steps:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-take 1 cup of uncooked rice; rinse it thoroughly;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-add 2-3 glasses of water; leave for 30 minutes;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-strain the rice water into a clean bowl.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This method will appeal to those who are very busy and don’t have much time.</p>
 
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>-Boiled rice water for hair recipe.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Making boiled rice water for hair is super-easy as well:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-take ½ cup of rice;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-add 1 glass of water;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-cook the rice in the boiling water;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-strain the rice water into a clean bowl before use.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is a concentrated liquid that you can dilute before rinsing the hair. The concentration of dilution depends on the hair length and greasiness. Usually, it’s 1:10. The oilier the hair is, the lower the concentration should be.</p>
 
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>-Fermented rice water for hair recipe.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How to make rice water for hair that is called ‘fermented’? Do the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-take 2 cups of rice;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-add 2 times more water to it;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-leave the rice to soak for 20-30 minutes;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-pour the water into a glass bottle, seal it and leave in a dark place at room temperature for 12-24 hours (not more than 2 days);</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">-when a sour smell appears, stop fermentation and put it in a fridge to preserve all the beneficial properties obtained during fermentation (it can be kept for a week in the fridge).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fermentation reduces the pH level of rice water to the pH level of the hair and nourishes it better due to the effective penetration of vitamins into the scalp and hair structure. Helps with oily scalp too.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>What Ingredients to Add to Rice Water</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You also ask about the additional ingredients, like orange peels and <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/essential-oils-for-hair-growth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">essential oils</a>. Yes, rice water can be mixed with orange peels, or several drops of your fave essential oil to help with the smell. Sometimes rice water is mixed with lime juice or <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/aloe-vera-for-hair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">aloe vera</a>. Some women also add a natural clarifier (a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar, or the same amount of tea tree oil) to prevent buildup over time. However, it is probably better to check out how rice water works on your hair without any additives. And only after the first positive results, you may do your own recipes.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>How to Store Rice Water</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can store rice water in the refrigerator for a week in a bowl with a lid. Shake it well before use. Also, you can freeze it if needed.</p>
[caption id="attachment_19298" align="aligncenter" width="1080"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-store-rice-water-for-hair-CHA2FLcl8jX.jpg" alt="How to Store Rice Water for Hair in Freezer" width="1080" height="1080"/> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yeka_herbal_cosmetics/" target="_blank" >Yeka</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>What Type of Rice Is the Best for Hair Care</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Does it have to be white rice or can the rice water be from wild rice? Will black rice water for hair work? There are more than 40000 rice varieties. What is the best rice type for hair growth and hair care in general?</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The most widely known is the <strong>Asian type of rice</strong> (scientifically called Oryza sativa). Its two main subspecies are indica and japonica.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are <strong>whole</strong> and <strong>refined</strong> rice types. Whole rice is in its intact form, it’s black, purple, or red in color and more nutrient-rich. Refined rice is polished, and thus white. A lot of nutrients are taken away during this process. However, some of them (B vitamins and iron) are added back (sprayed) and that’s when we see the word ‘enriched’ on the packaging.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Brown rice</strong> contains more nutrients such as phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium. <strong>Black rice</strong> contains anthocyanin antioxidants - the same that are found in blueberries and blackberries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Parboiled rice</strong> is processed in a very special way: it’s soaked and steamed with the hull, then dried, and the hulls are removed. Grains absorb more nutrients (vitamin B and potassium).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What about the <strong>wild rice</strong>? It is in fact even not rice. It is a semi-aquatic grass, however, it also contains protein (even more than brown rice), and is very high in minerals. Women also use it to prepare the rice water.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, what type of rice to take for rice hair water? In general, you may take any rice you have on your hand. If you want the maximum amount of nutrients and high levels of protein, opt for more natural kinds - wild, brown, or black. However, to avoid protein overload, you may start with the simpler rice types, and then experiment with other species.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>How to Use Rice Water for Hair</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How to apply rice water to hair and how long to leave it in the hair? You can apply rice water (boiled, soaked, or fermented) after using your regular shampoo and conditioner. Pour a bit of your rice water rinse onto your <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/scalp-massagers-and-massage-for-hair-growth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">scalp</a> and hair, leave for at least 5-10 minutes (better for 20-30), rinse, and continue your usual hair washing routine.</p>
[bq_1]NOTE! Some women prefer to co-wash hair before using rice water instead of shampooing, as a shampoo+rice water duo dries their hair out.[/bq_1]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>How Often to Use Rice Water for Hair</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It’s recommended to use rice water for hair no more than once/twice a week. Dry, brittle, and <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/how-to-fix-frizzy-hair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">frizzy hair</a> as a result of rice water overuse is a reality. In this case, forget about rice water for some time and avoid any protein-packed hair products. Clarify your hair and <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/deep-conditioning-hair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">deep condition</a> a lot.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Rice Water Conditioner for Hair</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can also use diluted rice water as a conditioner. Apply it to wet, clean hair, massage the scalp slightly and rinse after 5-10 minutes. For additional nourishment, you can add a few drops of essential oil, such as rosemary, lavender, or geranium.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Rice Water Shampoo for Hair</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To make a shampoo, mix rice water and flour and let it brew for 5-10 minutes. Use it as a stand-alone product or in a 1:1 ratio with your regular shampoo.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Rice Water for Curly Hair</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Curly hair is drier and more brittle. The protein, contained in rice water, penetrates deeply and improves the condition of the hair, making it bouncy and manageable. There is no need to use rice water as a leave-in, 15-30 minutes will be enough for the useful elements to penetrate the hair and remain in it even after washing off. Since curly hair types tend to be drier, it is not recommended to use rice water for curls more than 1-2 times per week. Deep-conditioning is a must.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Rice Water for Hair FAQ</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Time for the final Q&A section about rice water for scalp and hair.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Does rice water grow hair?</strong> Yes, rice water can help your hair to grow if you apply it regularly. This works not for all women, but you need to give it a chance, check out the results on your type of hair, and make the final decision.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How fast does rice water grow hair?</strong> You may see the first hair growth results in a week. The first hair improvements (volume, shine, thickness, manageability) you will see after just one wash.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Can you eat the rice after making rice water?</strong> The rice from the boiling method is edible, so the one that is left after short soaking (only after cooking it). Do not eat raw or fermented rice.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Can you use this on color-treated hair?</strong> Yes, sure, rice water is harmless for colored hair. It will not make it change its color either. However, if your hair is dry, as we have mentioned above, it may become brittle.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What about drinking rice water for hair growth?</strong> Drinking cooked rice water helps digestion and your overall health, but not hair growth directly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What ingredients are not allowed to be used with rice water on hair?</strong> There are no known ingredients that can negatively interfere with any type of rice water, be it the short soaked, long soaked (fermented), or boiled rice water.</p>

Some cleansing herbs that you may want to consider adding are airtha, shikakai, hibiscus, ambunu, and clays. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKekDsyAIFJ/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">@dearlovelynaturalhair</a>[/bq_3]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Do we need to use rice water after applying oil or before?</strong> No need to change your hair washing and hair care routines. It is a treatment applied after shampoo/conditioner and it should be rinsed off. Then do whatever you usually do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Does rice water contain arsenic?</strong> Rice may contain arsenic, which is absorbed from the ground and water. However, arsenic in rice may be a concern for the people who EAT rice every day in large amounts. If you use rice water 1-2 times per week, you should not worry.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Can rice water be used on plaited hair?</strong> Yes, of course, you can use rice water on protective hairstyles, including <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/braided-hairstyles/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">braids</a> and twists.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>What will happen if you wash your face with rice water?</strong> Nothing special. Your rice water for hair will be good for the face too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Can rice water be used daily?</strong> It is not a good idea to overload your hair with protein.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Can you leave rice water in hair overnight?</strong> There is no need for using rice water before going to bed and leaving it overnight in most cases. Protein overload (too much protein and not enough moisture) may be even worse than the lack of it.</p>
