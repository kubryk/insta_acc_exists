<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>What Is Rice Water</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is a hair treatment, used by women centuries ago, that is in fact just some starchy water left after the rice is cooked, or it can also be the water in which it has been soaked for a while.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Rice contains Vitamins B1 and B6, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Selenium, Manganese, and a lot of other components. The composition of water from this grain is rich in <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/vitamins-for-hair-growth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">vitamins</a> too, especially B and C. It also contains trace elements – potassium, iodine, magnesium, zinc, selenium, manganese, and a lot of fiber.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We need to mention the inositol here too, as it is a substance that is used to treat different medical conditions and believed to balance women's hormones, which can help in reversing <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/hairstyles-for-thin-hair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thinning hair</a>. You may not only take inositol supplements but also feed your hair with it from the outside.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, this cereal and water out of it is a real treasure trove of nutrients that nourish the follicles and repair damaged cells.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Benefits for Hair</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What does rice water do for your hair? The main benefits for locks are: creating a better scalp environment, helping in strengthening the hair cuticle, <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/how-to-get-shiny-hair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">boosting the hair shine</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The available research is not full enough to make us 100% sure that this solution is ALWAYS a cure and that it will 100% help you with hair growth. It is even said that the protein here is too large to penetrate the strands and it only coats them and prevents them from drying out. So, it is the 'length retention', not the growth in fact. However, the results of women with different hair types who have tried it are quite eloquent.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>How to Make Soaked, Boiled, and Fermented Solution From Rice</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How to make this miraculous remedy at home? There are 3 most popular and effective ways. You can try all of them and choose the one you like the most. Basically, you’ll need only two ingredients!</p>
 
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>- Soaked Rice Water.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You will need to follow these steps:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- take 1 cup of uncooked rice; rinse it thoroughly;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- add 2-3 glasses of water; leave for 30 minutes;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- strain the rice water into a clean bowl.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This method will appeal to those who are very busy and don’t have much time.</p>
 
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>- Boiled Rice Water.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Making this solution is super-easy as well:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- take ½ cup of rice;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- add 1 glass of water;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- cook the grain in the boiling water;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- strain into a clean bowl before use.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is a concentrated liquid that you can dilute before rinsing the hair. The concentration of dilution depends on the hair length and greasiness. Usually, it’s 1:10. The oilier the hair is, the lower the concentration should be.</p>
 
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>- Fermented Rice Water.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"> Do the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- take 2 cups of rice;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- add 2 times more water to it;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- leave the grain to soak for 20-30 minutes;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- pour the water into a glass bottle, seal it and leave in a dark place at room temperature for 12-24 hours (not more than 2 days);</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">- when a sour smell appears, stop fermentation and put it in a fridge to preserve all the beneficial properties obtained during fermentation (it can be kept for a week in the fridge).</p> 

<p style="text-align: left;">Fermentation reduces the pH level of rice water to the pH level of the hair and nourishes it better due to the effective penetration of vitamins into the scalp and hair structure. Helps with oily scalp too.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Additional Ingredients</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You also ask about the additional ingredients, like orange peels and <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/essential-oils-for-hair-growth/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">essential oils</a>. Yes, it can be mixed with orange peels, or several drops of your fave essential oil to help with the smell. Sometimes it is mixed with lime juice or <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/aloe-vera-for-hair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">aloe vera</a>. Some women also add a natural clarifier (a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar, or the same amount of tea tree oil) to prevent buildup over time. However, it is probably better to check out how this solution works on your hair without any additives. And only after the first positive results, you may do your own recipes.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Storage Advice</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can store it in the refrigerator for a week in a bowl with a lid. Shake it well before use. Also, you can freeze it if needed.</p>
[caption id="attachment_19298" align="aligncenter" width="1080"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/how-to-store-rice-water-for-hair-CHA2FLcl8jX.jpg" alt="How to Store Rice Water for Hair in Freezer" width="1080" height="1080"/> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yeka_herbal_cosmetics/" target="_blank" >Yeka</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>What Type of Rice Is the Best for Hair Care</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The most widely known is the Asian type of this cereal (scientifically called Oryza sativa). Its two main subspecies are indica and japonica.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are whole and refined types of this grain. Whole rice is in its intact form, it’s black, purple, or red in color and more nutrient-rich. Refined rice is polished, and thus white. A lot of nutrients are taken away during this process. However, some of them (B vitamins and iron) are added back (sprayed) and that’s when we see the word ‘enriched’ on the packaging.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Brown rice contains more nutrients such as phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium. Black contains anthocyanin antioxidants - the same that are found in blueberries and blackberries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Parboiled - is processed in a very special way: it’s soaked and steamed with the hull, then dried, and the hulls are removed. Grains absorb more nutrients (vitamin B and potassium).</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What about the wild one? It is a semi-aquatic grass, however, it also contains protein (even more than the brown type), and is very high in minerals. Women also use it to prepare the hair treatment.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So, what type of rice to take? In general, you may take any type of this grain you have on your hand. If you want the maximum amount of nutrients and high levels of protein, opt for more natural kinds - wild, brown, or black. However, to avoid protein overload, you may start with the simpler types, and then experiment with other species.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>How to Use</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How to apply it and how long to leave it in the hair? You can apply it after using your regular shampoo and conditioner. Pour a bit of your handmade starchy solution onto your scalp and hair, leave for at least 5-10 minutes (better for 20-30), rinse, and continue your usual hair washing routine.</p>
[bq_1]NOTE! Some women prefer to co-wash hair before using this solution instead of shampooing, as a shampoo+rice water duo dries their hair out.[/bq_1]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>How Often to Use This Treatment</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It’s recommended to use it for your hair no more than once/twice a week. Dry, brittle, and <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/how-to-fix-frizzy-hair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">frizzy hair</a> as a result of rice water overuse is a reality. In this case, forget about rice water for some time and avoid any protein-packed hair products. Clarify your hair and <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/deep-conditioning-hair/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">deep condition</a> a lot.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Hair Conditioner Recipe</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You can also use diluted rice water as a conditioner. Apply it to wet, clean hair, massage the scalp slightly and rinse after 5-10 minutes. For additional nourishment, you can add a few drops of essential oil, such as rosemary, lavender, or geranium.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Shampoo Recipe</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">To make a shampoo, mix rice water and flour and let it brew for 5-10 minutes. Use it as a stand-alone product or in a 1:1 ratio with your regular shampoo.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>Curly Hair Treatment</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Curly hair is drier and more brittle. The protein from this cereal penetrates deeply and improves the condition of the hair, making it bouncy and manageable. There is no need to use it as a leave-in, 15-30 minutes will be enough for the useful elements to penetrate the hair and remain in it even after washing off. Since curly hair types tend to be drier, it is not recommended to this treatment on your curls more than 1-2 times per week. Deep-conditioning is a must.</p>
