<p style="text-align: left;">Are you in search of some really working haircuts and hairstyles for big foreheads? Good news: they exist!</p><!--more-->

<p style="text-align: left;">If your forehead is looking more like a “fivehead”, it can be difficult to find a good haircut that frames your face. Thankfully, there are a few hairstyle cheat-codes that can balance your features and proportions of your face. So, whether you want long hair, short hair, medium-length curls, new bangs or a cute pixie cut, there’s a flattering hairdo for you!</p>

[bq_2]<p style="text-align: left;">Is your forehead big/wide/broad? According to the ‘golden ratio’ theory, the three-thirds of our face are supposed to be equal (1.the middle of the hairline-the point between the eyebrows, 2.the point between the eyebrows-the bottom of the nose, 3.the bottom of the nose-the bottom of the chin). If the upper third is significantly bigger... yes, these foreheads are considered as large. The other, simpler measurement is to count how many fingers you can place (horizontally) between the hairline and eyebrows. Four is the norm. Five – your forehead is big.</p>[/bq_2]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. Long Parted Bangs.</strong> Make your forehead smaller by sweeping the bangs to the sides of your face.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>9. Messy Waves with Off-Center Parting.</strong> While a sharp center parting might only accentuate the narrow face with a long forehead, moving the part to a side and pairing it with textured waves provides both cover and width.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>10. Straight Hair with Wispy Bangs.</strong> Vice versa, the broad forehead and wide cheekbones here require elongation, and they get it with the straight shoulder-length hairstyle complemented by the wispy fringe getting longer and thicker toward the edges.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>11. Neat Eyebrow-Skimming Bangs with Long Hair.</strong> The secret of such a cute look is the accurate textured bangs. The right hairstyles for big foreheads hide the disproportion and balance out your face shape. Tell your stylist to cut the bangs thick and falling a little past your eyebrows for a sexy forehead-concealing hairstyle.</p>
