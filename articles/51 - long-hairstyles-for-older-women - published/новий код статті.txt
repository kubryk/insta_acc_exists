[bq_4]Do you have any good examples of long haircuts for women over 50? Thanks![/bq_4]

<p style="text-align: left;">We don’t need the latest statistics to see older women with long hair being in the minority these days. It comes as no surprise considering the fact that until recently, we all believed that more inches can make us look only older, not to mention the trickier maintenance. However, the pictures below sell the idea of sticking to your preferred length regardless of your age – you just need to understand what to pay attention to.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Long Fine Hair.</strong> We are lucky to have messy hairstyles trending since they are perfect for mature ladies with <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/long-thin-hair/" target="_blank">longer thin locks</a>. From beachy waves to tousled ponytails, they give us a chance to bring in texture and get the roots elevated without tipping over into outdated bouffants.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Gray Highlights.</strong> You can take a different route since you are not bound to go solid gray. Depending on your preferred color scheme, gray streaks are capable of creating stunning contrasts, delivering a sun-kissed effect, or adding the required depth to <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/very-thin-hair/" target="_blank">thinning locks</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Haircut with Bangs.</strong> Any <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/hairstyles-for-women-over-50/"  target="_blank">hairdos for older women</a> with longer locks can be easily updated with bangs. A choppy fringe is today’s go-to option that flatters almost any face shape and allows for a fresher and classier look without much maintenance. Alternatively, go for side-swept bangs to gently frame your face.</p>
