 <p style="text-align: left;">What are curtain bangs? This is a type of bangs that frames the face on both sides. They are cut shorter on the inside and become gradually longer outside. Most often such fringe is center-parted.<!--more--></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Should you get them? This depends on your face shape and your goal. They perfectly hide big foreheads, are very good for showing beautiful cheekbones, and always highlight your best features, if cut right. They are good for all face shapes! You just need to find a skilled hairstylist to choose the ones that suit you.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">There are many different options to style this type of fringe depending on the hair type and your face shape. Here are some top-class examples of a perfect curtain fringe for your reference.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Straight Highlighted Style.</strong> A fringe may involve highlights that emphasize your eye color. This hairdo looks current and effortless, which can be perfect for work or play.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Bangs with Defined Disconnection.</strong> While many hairstyles blend such fringe types into face-framing layers to create a seamless flow of strands, these long strands are paired with clearly disconnected pieces to give them some interest and balance the oblong face shape.</p>
