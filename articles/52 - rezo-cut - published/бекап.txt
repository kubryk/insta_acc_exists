[bq_4]Do I need to get a Rezo cut? How to know if it is flattering for my type of hair?[/bq_4]

<p style="text-align: left;">The Rezo haircut is one of the most popular curly cuts nowadays. However, it is often confused with other similar cuts. Let’s dive into this and find out what defines the Rezo cut and what type of hair it fits best.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What Is a Rezo Cut?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Rezo cut is a technique done on dry hair that allows you to create mega volume and enhance the beauty of your curls. This cut can only be done on ladies with naturally wavy and <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/natural-curly-hairstyles/" target="_blank">curly hair</a> starting with the 2B type. To get the Rezo cut, you will need to have your locks sectioned in V’s and cut in triangles and circles to get the round shape. The haircut is easily maintained, and you won’t have to visit your stylist more often than once in 3-6 months.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rezo Vs. Deva Cut</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It’s safe to say that the Rezo cut and the Deva cut are pretty similar and are often mixed up. However, there’s a clear difference between the two: after the <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/deva-cut/" target="_blank">Deva cut</a> your curls frame your face, while after the Rezo your hair preserves an even length around your head.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Rezo Cut Vs Diametrix Cut</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another hairstyle that people often take for the Rezo cut is the Diametrix cut. The latter features the inner layer sliding technique that the Rezo doesn’t have. The Diametrix cut was created for women who are not fond of the Rezo’s pyramid shape, which is often the case for girls with really curly hair.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Should You Get a Rezo Cut?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As we’ve mentioned before, the Rezo cut is an amazing option for all girls with different curl types. If you need to make your locks more voluminous and defined, find a good Rezo-certified hairstylist and enjoy the result!</p>
