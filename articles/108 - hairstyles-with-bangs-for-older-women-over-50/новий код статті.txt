<p style="text-align: left;">In this article we’re sharing hairstyles with bangs for women over 50. As we grow older, our skin changes and so does our hair - often becoming thinner and, in some cases, more brittle. At the same time, other women over 50, still have thick locks and need fringe hairstyles for their hair type and texture.</p><!--more-->

<p style="text-align: left;">So, should older women wear bangs or not? Is there the one-size-fits-all type of bangs that flatters all women over 40, over 50, and over 60? We have answers and ideas for all of you. Check out the pictures with tips and tricks below!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Getting older doesn’t mean that you have to compromise on style and, as we’ve shown in this article, bangs for women over 50 can be extremely flattering as well as practical. Bangs on older women help to frame the face while concealing fine lines on the forehead which older ladies are often self-conscious about. If you’re unsure about bangs or no bangs over 50, your hairstylist will advise you on the best style for your hair type and face shape.</p>
