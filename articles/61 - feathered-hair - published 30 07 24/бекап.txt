<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>What Is a Feather Haircut?</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Feathered hair is a unisex haircut resembling the layering of bird feathers, which has been one of the trademarks of the 1970s and 1980s. For a feathered hairstyle, the hair is usually cut with a razor comb and brushed away from the face, thus adding extra texture to the look.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><center>What Is the Difference Between Layered and Feathered Hair?</center></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Layers are certainly one of the features of a feathered hairstyle, but they do not equal feathers. Feathering is a texturizing technique to shape the ends of the hair, while layering provides various lengths throughout your locks.</p>
