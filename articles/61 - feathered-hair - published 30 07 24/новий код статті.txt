<p style="text-align: left;">Are you curious about trying a feathered hairstyle? Go for it! Modern hair trends include a number of cuts that were made popular in the 1970s. The layered airy look is comfortable and easy to wear throughout the day. That's why such haircuts тумук lose their popularity!<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Find what you need in our comprehensive guide featuring different versions of this timeless favorite. Take into account your preferences and face shape, look through and choose a few haircuts that you may want to try.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First of all, what haircut are we talking about? It is a unisex haircut resembling the layering of bird feathers, which has been one of the trademarks of the 1970s and 1980s. For such a hairstyle, the hair is usually cut with a razor comb and brushed away from the face, thus adding extra texture to the look.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">What is the difference between traditional layered haircuts and haircuts with feathering? Feathering is a texturizing technique to shape the ends of the hair, while layering provides various lengths throughout your locks. Now let's see the coolest examples of short, medium and long heavy-layered haircuts for all hair types and hair textures.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Classic Short Pixie.</strong> Women in their 30s or 40s will certainly appreciate this classic short cut. Not only will it add more glamour to your overall look, but it also makes you look even younger than you really are.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Voluminous Pixie.</strong> When you are <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/haircuts-for-women-over-40/" target="_blank">in your 40s</a>, it may be difficult to have a hairstyle that looks good only when styled in the hairdresser’s chair – which is why you might want to find an alternative. As a solution, this short style only needs some mousse and you’re good to go.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Medium-Length Shag.</strong> Whether you have blonde or dark locks, people will definitely get some serious 70s rock’n’roll vibes, especially if you have a fringe.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4. Pixie Bob.</strong> The elegant pixie bob will enhance your best facial features rather than just hide them in case you have an oval face. It is also a perfect refreshing hairstyle for those who are looking for a change.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>6. Shaggy Thin Hair.</strong> The general problem with <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/hairstyles-for-thin-hair/" target="_blank">thin hair</a> is that it’s very difficult to make voluminous and dimensional. However, by adding some layers and bangs, your hair should be able to breathe more and get an airier look.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>7. Flipped-Up Medium Hair.</strong> Flipped up styles have a way of adding movement and bounce to <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/medium-length-layered-haircuts/" target="_blank">medium-length hair</a>. Talk to your hairstylist and ask if they can add stepped layers. This way, you may easily style your hair at home.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>8. Long Layered Locks.</strong> Layering is a great way to <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/how-to-add-volume-to-hair/" target="_blank">make your hair look more voluminous</a>, even if you’ve got rather long locks that are on the thinner side. Dry shampoo will help you get this hairdo.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>9. Messy Flipped Locks.</strong> If you are going for Kim Kardashian’s hairstyle, then you might want to try out the flip cut.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>10. Ashy Blonde with Bangs.</strong> This icy style successfully combines fine face-framing layers with a wispy fringe that is made even lighter thanks to the textured ends.</p>
[caption id="attachment_27985" align="aligncenter" width="1357"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-ashy-blonde-hair-with-wispy-bangs-CoFeJPjJHAW.jpg" alt="Feathered Shag with Wispy Bangs" width="1357" height="1440" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hair.juancarlos/" target="_blank" >hair.juancarlos</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>11. Long Butterfly Layers.</strong> Butterfly cuts are all the rage nowadays, and this dirty blonde style features the trendy sectioned shape with volume created both around the face and at the ends.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>12. Beachy Highlighted Medium Hair.</strong> Beach waves always look good with layers, as they make it seem even more voluminous. For more structure, you may also add <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/balayage-hair/" target="_blank">highlights</a> to emphasize the summer-ready vibe.</p>
[caption id="attachment_8253" align="aligncenter" width="1059"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/17-medium-hair-with-beachy-waves-B7zrGXkjhMh.jpg" alt="Medium Feather Cut with Beachy Waves" width="1059" height="1232" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shelleysmellll/" target="_blank" >Michelle Petronaci</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>13. Dark Brunette Long Locks.</strong> Hair tends to lie flat after it goes past a certain length. However, by adopting the right type of a layered cut for long hair, you’ll give it some extra bounce and dimension.</p>
[caption id="attachment_8248" align="aligncenter" width="1080"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/12-feather-cut-for-long-thick-hair-B8Jzbjegdfh.jpg" alt="Long Feather Cut for Thick Hair" width="1080" height="1350" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xiomarabeauty/" target="_blank" >xiomarabeauty</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>14. Long Flowy Layers.</strong> A hairstyle we are all used to, it only needs a hairbrush and perhaps some mousse to maintain. It’s full of movement even without styled waves.</p>
[caption id="attachment_8266" align="aligncenter" width="1039"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/30-long-haircut-with-layers-B8C9XvPgXgj.jpg" alt="Flowy Long Feather Haircut" width="1039" height="1297" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hairbylynnettewinters/" target="_blank" >Lynnette Winters</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>15. Red-Brown Medium Layers.</strong> Medium-length hair will also benefit from being cut into a refreshing <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/shag-haircuts/" target="_blank">piece-y shag</a> – and this medium haircut is proof of that. Once again, we witness a lovely look from the 80s or 90s but it has undergone a serious modern update.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>16. Feathered Bangs.</strong> Bangs add a certain degree of playfulness – that’s why layers with bangs seem like a suitable choice. A wonderful solution for women with thick hair who want to somewhat reduce that frizz.</p>
[caption id="attachment_8239" align="aligncenter" width="1059"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3-feathered-hairstyle-with-bangs-B8C-6cHBXFz.jpg" alt="Long Feathered Haircut with Bangs" width="1059" height="1243" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/veronicajoneshair/" target="_blank" >Veronica</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>17. Flipped Out Ends.</strong> The ‘60s hair flip is officially back, so this bouncy style with tons of short layers created on the bottom latches on to the trend and maximizes the volume with the flippy ends.</p>
[caption id="attachment_27987" align="aligncenter" width="1080"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-thick-feathered-hair-Cdo3A2htv-9.jpg" alt="Bouncy Feathered Hairstyle for Thick Hair" width="1080" height="1080" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alessandra_nakamura/" target="_blank" >Alessandra Nakamura</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>18. Layers and Wispy Bangs.</strong> Moderately layered hairstyles also fit perfectly into the resurgence of iconic ‘90s looks fueled by Y2K nostalgia, including Pamela Anderson’s bouncy blonde layers complemented with her signature wispy bangs.</p>
[caption id="attachment_27988" align="aligncenter" width="1315"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-feathered-baby-hair-with-wispy-bangs-CmH7KkFP6AX.jpg" alt="One-Length Feathered Hairstyle with Wispy Bangs" width="1315" height="1698" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/salt_andwaves/" target="_blank" >salt_andwaves</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>19. Side-Swept Messy Crop.</strong> The advantage of a side-swept style is that you just need to brush your hair to the side in the morning, and the layers underneath will do the rest.</p>
[caption id="attachment_8259" align="aligncenter" width="793"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/23-messy-undercut-hairstyle-B5pvNZChcBj.jpg" alt="Undercut Hairstyle with Side-Swept Layers" width="793" height="1048" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the.hairsmith/" target="_blank" >Brian</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>20. Highlighted Layers and Bangs.</strong> The sweep-away layered bangs are the main feature of this hairstyle that attracts everyone’s attention. Add highlights to imitate a sun-kissed look.</p>
[caption id="attachment_19159" align="aligncenter" width="1080"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/2-sun-kissed-long-hair-CRYv-GxJ3Ke.jpg" alt="Sun-Kissed Feathered Long Hair" width="1080" height="1350" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/franky__v/" target="_blank" >Frank Vene</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>21. Airy Long Layers.</strong> Tons of layers look great on both thin and coarse hair. If yours is more like the latter, consider feathering hair for a beachy vibe. This will also make your hair look lighter and more feminine.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>22. Long Shag.</strong> Silver hair is a major eye-catcher, but going a little extra never killed anybody, right? Such layers will provide texture and volume for your hair.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>23. Wolf Haircut.</strong> Wolf cuts have given us a chance to reinvent shags and mullets, but the desired choppiness can be achieved in many ways, for example, with a layered rather than choppy finish.</p>
[caption id="attachment_27989" align="aligncenter" width="1296"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-platinum-feathery-hairstyle-CVogt08JATV.jpg" alt="Platinum Feathery Wolf Cut" width="1296" height="1488" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/seonasam/" target="_blank" >seonasam</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>24. Gray Layered Hair.</strong> Gray hair is trendy no matter what your actual age is. If you are lucky enough to have long, thick locks, get some layers and dye your hair <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/gray-highlights/" target="_blank">different shades of gray</a> for a more textured look.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>26. Mid-Length Brown Shag.</strong> This haircut shows another approach to voguish wolf cuts, keeping the bangs on the longer side and shifting the layers toward the lower part while styling the cut with flipped-up ends.</p>
[caption id="attachment_27990" align="aligncenter" width="1288"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/6-mid-length-hair-with-flipped-up-ends-Cgk1zofsJUD.jpg" alt="Mid-Length Feathery Hair with Flipped-Up Ends" width="1288" height="1391" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sabrayna_/" target="_blank" >Sabrina</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>28. Angled Bixie.</strong> This edgy cut basically mimics the shape of an A-line bob but adds closely cropped back and sides borrowed from the classic pixie style to arrive at enhanced volume on the crown.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>30. Spiky Haircut.</strong> Apart from making your strands airier, such layered ends give your hair a texture to play with, for example, by shaping the tapered tips into spikes which can stick out on the crown or be pushed forward.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>34. Layers and Contrasting Balayage.</strong> Not every hairstyle needs to look as if you’ve spent two hours on it. Messy cuts look even sexier, making people think that’s the hairdo you woke up to.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>35. Long Hair Side Bangs.</strong> A side fringe is a great option, particularly for women with round faces, as it makes a <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/bangs-for-round-faces/" target="_blank">round face look slimmer</a>. Also, such layers catch so much attention!</p>
