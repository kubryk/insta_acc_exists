<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>15. Tousled Bob with Textured Ends.</strong> The heavily sliced ends of this short brunette hair fill in the space around the chin and make the hairstyle appear fuller right where the face looks its thinnest.</p> 
[caption id="attachment_31449" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/2-sliced-bob-with-textured-ends-Cwh0fxorhoD.jpg" alt="Sliced Lob for an Oval Face" width="1440" height="1571" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ilhankaymak/" target="_blank" >ilhankaymak</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>17. Layered Bob with Blonde Balayage.</strong> Here is a great bob cut for women with thinner faces since the combo of strategically placed layers, tousled waves, and blonde highlights gives the required width to offset the narrowness.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>18. Shaggy Lob with Curtain Bangs.</strong> Flat hair hanging around the face can impair the balance of the oval shape, which just cannot happen with a heavily layered cut full of movement and texture.</p>
[caption id="attachment_24413" align="aligncenter" width="1016"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2-shaggy-lob-with-bangs-CiQVszjJ4qv.jpg" alt="Oval Face and Layered Lob" width="1016" height="1134" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hirohair/" target="_blank" >hirohair</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>19. Asymmetrical Caramel Brown Lob.</strong> We can only praise the idea of accentuating the oval face shape with highlights, but make sure to choose a shade that complements your complexion.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>21. Neck-Length Hairstyle with Front Bangs.</strong> Are you ready to commit to having bangs? Another great haircut for an oval face with bangs is the one covering your forehead. To get <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/bangs-for-face-shape/" target="_blank">the most flattering bangs</a>, make sure they graze just above or entirely cover your eyebrows.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>22. Shoulder-Length Hair with Layered Bottom.</strong> This hairstyle features fairly straight pieces flowing along the face yet it gains dimension and bounce a bit below the jawline, thus avoiding the flat feel.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>23. Choppy Mid-Length Brunette Hair.</strong> Shaggy oval-face haircuts are strongly recommended by hair stylists because they create much volume at the jawline, the narrowest part of an oval face.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>27. Bouncy Ends and Face-Framing Layers.</strong> Long and heavy one-length hair can easily weigh you down, which is not the case with smartly layered haircuts for oval faces like this one. It amplifies the bounce around the tips and deposits volume along the face.</p>    
[caption id="attachment_31451" align="aligncenter" width="1280"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/5-armpit-length-layered-hair-Cuo5ZckNNYl.jpg" alt="Oval Face and Armpit-Length Layered Hair" width="1280" height="1505" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mbhues/" target="_blank" >mbhues</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>28. A-Line Haircut with Sharp Center Parting.</strong> Wearing your mid-length hair perfectly center-parted is the best way to spotlight the symmetry of an oval face, while getting it graduated toward the front adds fullness to thinner strands.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>30. Long Blonde Butterfly Haircut.</strong> Although we are used to seeing butterfly cuts parted in the middle, girls with oval faces can safely play with bangs and throw them to a side when they want to switch the look effortlessly.</p>    
[caption id="attachment_31453" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/7-butterfly-haircut-with-feathered-bangs-CxocHjdOIeJ.jpg" alt="Long Haircut with Long Feathered Bangs" width="1440" height="1800" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brunohfnunes/" target="_blank" >brunohfnunes</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>31. Textured Bob for Long Oval Face.</strong> Not all oval faces are ideally balanced, and here we can see how the masterfully carved face-framing pieces visually reduce a large forehead and shift attention to the beautiful cheekbones.</p>
[caption id="attachment_24419" align="aligncenter" width="995"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/8-textured-bob-for-long-oval-faces-Cdgl_A5PvQJ.jpg" alt="Oval Face Lob with Face-Framing Pieces" width="995" height="1146" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hirohair/" target="_blank" >hirohair</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>37. Face-Framing Balayage for Long Hair.</strong> We have another rule for you, girls: the best haircuts for oval faces work to show off the shape of your face, for example, by illuminating bright blonde highlights.</p>
