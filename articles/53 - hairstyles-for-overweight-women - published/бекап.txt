<p style="text-align: left;">Knowing how to choose the right hairstyles for overweight women is a must! It is a necessity for ladies with a feminine body at any age. However, many of our readers ask us to show them haircuts for women over 50 and overweight. So, in this article, we have rounded up a selection of the 30 most fascinating hairstyles for over 50 and overweight women, but they will definitely work perfectly for any age.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Check out and let us know what you think in the comments below!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Feathered Shag Haircut.</strong> Does short hair make you look thinner or fatter? Well, it depends on how you style your hair. Adding some height to the crown with wispy layers makes your face appear longer. Layering short-to-medium hair definitely slims down a chubby face.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Short Blonde Hair.</strong> For a heavy-set woman with a round face, lovely blonde hair is a great asset. A medium-length shag is one of the most flattering haircuts for overweight women over 50. Face-framing layers and a side part help to make the face look less rounded. The layers and flyaways also give the extra volume and conceal thinning hair if it’s needed.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. Feminine Feathered Hairstyle.</strong> Opting for a medium hairstyle with feathered flipped-up layers is a great slimming hair hack for the overweight woman over 50. The uneven layers with their ends flipped backwards do a lot to narrow a round face and make it look less chubby.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>22. Choppy Brunette Hair with Lengthy Bangs.</strong> That’s why hair stylists recommend incorporating long side-swept bangs into plus-size hairstyles — they give the eye a vertical line to follow and hit the cheekbones to define them nicely.</p>
