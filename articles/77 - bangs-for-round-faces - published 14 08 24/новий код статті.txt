<p style="text-align: left;">Good bangs for round faces vary significantly in their length, shape, and style, but together with your hairstylist, you will be able to find the fringe that best flatters your face shape and features. In this article, you’ll get inspiring ideas for amazing bangs that look good with your face shape and suit all ages and lifestyles.</p><!--more-->

<p style="text-align: left;">There are several key principles to keep in mind when choosing between different types of bangs for your face. Firstly, they should visually elongate the face, making it look more oval. Long side-swept strands cope with this mission better than any other.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Another secret is to make some volume on the crown when styling your locks. Textured bangs, especially those cut above the eyes, perform a nice trick: they diffuse the roundness and open up your face. One more way to “cut” the excess width is to leave pieces in front of the ears.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The straight full fringe is among the things to avoid, as it shows off the roundness of the face. Nonetheless, a shorter length and longer pieces at the sides can make even a blunt bang flattering for the round face shape. The same goes for center parting: while this hairstyle is often the absolute no for your face shape, curtain bangs may eventually shift the focus away from the face roundness.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Look through these 50 handpicked variants to choose a perfect haircut for you!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Wispy Bangs.</strong> Long wispy strands might be one of the top-working ideas for your shape of face. Make it messy for a night out or switch to a center-parted hairstyle for a more official occasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>48. Cheekbone-Skimming Bangs.</strong> Cheek-grazing curtain bangs will make a fantastic frame for your face shape. It's a good idea to allow your hair to move well past your chin if you have a chubby face. Shoulder-length hair buys a longer shape for your features.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>50. Bedhead-Style Bangs.</strong> Frankly speaking, sleek and smooth hairstyles don't always go too well with your face shape. Neat bangs are no exception. Probably because they lack angles and a messy feel needed to ease the roundness. Bedhead is better for this purpose.</p>
