<p style="text-align: left;">Do bangs look good on round faces? Of course, they do! Good bangs for round face vary significantly in their length, shape, and style, but together with your hairstylist, you will be able to find the fringe that best flatters your face shape and features. In this article, you’ll get inspiring ideas for amazing bangs that look good with a round face and suit all ages and lifestyles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Best Round Face Haircuts with Bangs</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;">There are several key principles to keep in mind when choosing between different types of bangs for a round face. First, the bang should visually elongate the face, making it look more oval. Long <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/side-swept-bangs/" target="_blank"><strong>side-swept bangs</strong></a> cope with this mission better than any other.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Another secret is to make some volume on the crown when styling a bang. <strong>Textured bangs</strong>, especially those cut above the eyes, perform a nice trick: they diffuse the roundness and open up your face. One more way to “cut” the excess width is to leave pieces in front of the ears.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Straight full bangs are among the things to avoid, as they show off the roundness of the face. Nonetheless, a <strong>shorter length</strong> and <strong>longer pieces at the sides</strong> can make even a blunt bang flattering for the round face shape. The same goes for center parting: while this hairstyle is often the absolute no for round faces, <strong>curtain bangs</strong> may eventually shift the focus away from the face roundness.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Look through these 50 handpicked variants to choose a perfect fringe for your face shape.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Round Face Wispy Bangs.</strong> A long wispy bang might be one of the best ideas for a round face shape. Make it messy for a night out or switch to a center-parted hairstyle for a more official occasion.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Choppy Bang for a Round Face.</strong> Unlike straight or blunt bangs, choppy bangs are full of movement and texture. The uneven length helps to balance the roundness of the face.</p>
