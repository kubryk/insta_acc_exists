<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. Blunt Bob Cut.</strong> A blunt bob like this one defines the jawline and chin. It may both show off your beautiful face shape and give you a lifting effect, in case you need it.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>6. Textured Haircut.</strong> Although this cut is basically one length, it doesn’t feel totally blunt because of a few shorter pieces throughout the perimeter and nice point-cut ends. Complement it with long curtain bangs and messy styling to arrive at the modern shag.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>7. Wispy Razored Bob.</strong> The wispy bob cut with razored layers is a simple way to revive your straight <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/blonde-hair-colors/" target="_blank">blonde hair</a>. Your hairstyle can gain dimension and body with wispy layers and a subtle balayage dye job.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>8. Layered Waves.</strong> The <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/layered-bob/" target="_blank">layered bob</a> from the 1990s is still in style today! Sure, if you wear it elegantly, you'll have some over-the-top childhood vibes, but it'll be worth it.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>9. Straight Angled Locks.</strong> If you are not happy with your pin-straight hair, cutting the locks short and slicing them through the ends will remove weight and invoke a wave that can be further enhanced with just a bit of styling.</p>
[caption id="attachment_22098" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2-chin-length-hair-CW8kyPYPgqc.jpg" alt="Chin-Length Bob for Straight Hair" width="1440" height="1570" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shmoakin_hair/" target="_blank" >Sheridan Holyoak</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>10. Short Shaggy Stack.</strong> The stacked bob is another trendy look that will keep your neck cool in hot weather. The shaggy finish and subtle highlights make this look fashion-forward.</p>
[caption id="attachment_15928" align="aligncenter" width="1012"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8-shaggy-stacked-bob-CKCRbPAl7xX.jpg" alt="Trendy Chin-Length Shaggy Stacked Bob" width="1012" height="1020" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shmoakin_hair/" target="_blank" >Sheridan Holyoak</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>11. Multi-Shade Stacked Hair.</strong> This blonde style gains dimension through both cut and color since the layers in the back allow to lift the crown and the mix of light brown and blonde shades brings depth into the formula.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29872" align="aligncenter" width="1259"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/3-stacked-chin-length-bob-CpSzhIDvOjn.jpg" alt="Wispy Stacked Chin-Length Bob" width="1259" height="1390" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hair_museee/" target="_blank" >hair_museee</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>12. Round-Shape Bob.</strong> This ginger red chop features effortless curtain bangs and a retro inward flip, which playfully directs attention to the lips and radiates the cool 60s vibes.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>13. Jaw-Length Wispy Bob.</strong> Despite being fairly choppy, this rooty blonde cut feels elegant and neat rather than messy and wild, thanks to the thinned-out ends masterfully put in place.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29873" align="aligncenter" width="1344"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/4-jaw-length-blonde-bob-CoDTsiXp4Bi.jpg" alt="Elegant Layered Rooty Blonde Bob" width="1344" height="1555" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ro.hsiqueira/" target="_blank" >Rodrigo Siqueira</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>14. Shag with Bangs.</strong> This bob is adorned with shaggy curtain bangs to beautifully fit into the style cut blunt around the perimeter yet textured at the ends and styled messy.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29874" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/5-chin-length-bob-with-bangs-CcOCP6gJgGN.jpg" alt="Blunt Chin-Length Bob with Shaggy Styling" width="1440" height="1800" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/el_hair_hustler/" target="_blank" >Sally Salazar</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>15. Messy Beachy Waves.</strong> This hairstyle has a little bit of everything an "It" girl may need: graduation to build volume in the back, thinned-out ends to readily produce waves, and smart layering to deliver tons of movement.</p>
[caption id="attachment_22102" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6-messy-bob-with-beach-vibes-CXcLjUbFNQJ.jpg" alt="Bob with Layers and Beach Waves" width="1440" height="1799" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chrisjones_hair/" target="_blank" >Chris Jones</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>16. Choppy Feathered Cut.</strong> This cute blonde style is carved with a razor from the fringe to the numerous layers to remove weight for better lift and infuse the hair with tons of texture.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29875" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/6-choppy-bob-with-feathered-bangs-CtQIzd8roCv.jpg" alt="Short Feathered Bob with Enhanced Texture" width="1440" height="1440" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brianacisneros/" target="_blank" >Briana Cisneros</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>17. Angled Blunt Bob.</strong> Hair experts recommend jaw-length hairstyles with blunt ends as the safest bet for ladies with thin and fine hair, but you can enhance the fulness-adding effect of the blunt cut by asking for a bit longer pieces in the front.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29876" align="aligncenter" width="1334"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/7-chin-length-blunt-bob-CbKtGPvr8jG.jpg" alt="Chin-Length Angled Bob Hairstyle" width="1334" height="1360" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/headrushdesigns/" target="_blank" >Julie Facer</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>18. Blonde Off-Centered Locks.</strong> The clean lines and flawlessly polished finish of this rounded bob cut create a perfect canvas to showcase the stunning color job on the straight jaw-length hair.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>19. Shaggy Banged Waves.</strong> Here is another impressive example of razor cutting on jaw-length hair which builds volume with short layers on the top, releases soft waves all around, and fills the style with beautiful texture.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>20. Side-Swept Balayaged Bob.</strong> The trick to the low maintenance and crisp look of this blunt bob is its sliced-out ends which take away density and bring out movement but don't feel like layers.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29879" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/10-low-maintenance-chin-length-bob-with-balayage-CNSCzE4jiu-.jpg" alt="Crisp Low-Maintenance Chin-Length Bob" width="1440" height="1800" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gpexperienceamsterdam/" target="_blank" >gpexperienceamsterdam</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>21. Raven-Black Messy Ends.</strong> Here is a fresh take on the classic graduated bob that retains its overall smooth feel but gains texture towards the ends thanks to barely-there layers and careful point-cutting.</p>
[caption id="attachment_22104" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/8-soft-chin-length-bob-CZGHCoTOeny.jpg" alt="Fresh Graduated Chin-Length Bob" width="1440" height="1560" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/summerevansstudio/" target="_blank" >Summer Evans</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>22. Layers with Side Bangs.</strong> This is a great example of a highly customized hairstyle combining blunt ends on the bottom, volume-boosting layering through the mid-length, and a lot of face-framing pieces.</p>
[caption id="attachment_22105" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/9-blunt-bob-with-side-bangs-CZQ5zDsNEVp.jpg" alt="Blunt Bob with Face-Framing Layers" width="1440" height="1800" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/olgakursitis/" target="_blank" >Olga</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>23. Straight Thick Hair Stack.</strong> Ladies with poker-straight manes will be glad to have most of the weight removed while getting a neat shape instead, spiced up with a trifle of exterior layering.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29880" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/11-stacked-bob-with-layers-Ct9Q9qgOzgQ.jpg" alt="Straight Black Bob with Layering" width="1440" height="1573" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alessandra_nakamura/" target="_blank" >Alessandra Nakamura</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>24. Flipped In and Out Bob.</strong> This no-frills haircut gains extra texture and visual interest by pairing a gentle inside curve with the trendy winged fringe that has the ends styled in the opposite direction.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29881" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/12-trendy-chin-length-bob-CmMaYjqA_hB.jpg" alt="Trendy Chin-Length Bob Hairstyle" width="1440" height="1800" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/halosalonrossville/" target="_blank" >halosalonrossville</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>25. Tousled Lived-In Balayaged Bob.</strong> If you are after volumizing jaw-length haircuts for your fine hair, look no further than this nice combo of depth-adding balayage and messy styling.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29882" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/13-messy-bob-for-women-CVa69iQvvkA.jpg" alt="Messy Chin-Length Bob with Blonde Balayage" width="1440" height="1556" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chrisweberhair/" target="_blank" >Chris Weber</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>26. Bob with Caramel Highlights.</strong> Brunettes who lack density in their hair can stay on the darker side by bridging a deep base with natural-looking highlights and add dynamics to the flat strands by curling the mid shaft.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29883" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/14-chin-length-brunette-bob-Cs6xLn2gPXG.jpg" alt="Brunette Bob with Shaggy Waves" width="1440" height="1791" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rodrigues_ricardo/" target="_blank" >Ricardo</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>27. Chocolate Brown Internal Layers.</strong> Not only do internal layers reduce bulk in thicker hair, but they also produce texture within a blunt cut that becomes visible only when it gets curled.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29884" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/15-blunt-bob-with-texture-CqojdnyOz-I.jpg" alt="Chin-Length Blunt Bob with Texture" width="1440" height="1800" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rayvoltagebeauty/" target="_blank" >rayvoltagebeauty</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>28. One-Length Choppy Ends.</strong> While shorter layers may result in poufy hair on this texture, the jaw-level length lands enough debulking for a wavy pattern to appear and play well with the shagginess focused around the ends.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29885" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/16-one-length-blonde-bob-Cuj6uNFAP7_.jpg" alt="Choppy Chin-Length Blonde Bob" width="1440" height="1800" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/barbararabelo_/" target="_blank" >Barbara Rabelo</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>29. Center-Parted Inverted Bob.</strong> You may fail to recognize the inverted bob in this cut since it doesn’t feature a dramatic length drop and is further camouflaged by deep exterior feathering.</p>
[caption id="attachment_29886" align="aligncenter" width="1440"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/17-inverted-bob-cut-Clpa7vwuSuT.jpg" alt="Inverted Bob Cut with Feathering" width="1440" height="1700" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/summerevansstudio/" target="_blank" >summerevansstudio</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>30. Jagged Brown Bixie.</strong> If you have thin strands and like blunt hairstyles with cropped straight across ends, don’t miss a chance to try something a little different next time. With a texture-centered interior finish, you will enjoy both volume and movement.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to hairstyles that are cut around the jaw-length, there is a perfect haircut for every hair type and face shape. Add bangs, highlights, a non-banal hair color, and a bright smile on your face - and you will have a <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/haircuts-for-women/" target="_blank">killer style that is trendy</a> 365 days a year.</p>
