<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to layered hair, consider how you want your future layers fall and where they should start to flatter your face and work with your hair texture. If you want to find your dream hairstyle, read below for some inspiration!</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>1. Straight Hair.</strong> Make sure to use a blow dryer before you straighten so you can employ the root volume. Use a straightener to eliminate flyaways and keep things sleek.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. Mid Length Hair.</strong> This crisp cut with feathered ends is awesome in simple hairstyles when you can simply wash and air-dry your hair, especially if you’ve got a slightly wavy texture and a beautiful natural-looking color.</p>

The short layering in the front of your hair lets you wear your thick hair loose without it getting in the way.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>9. Deep Fringe and Side Layers.</strong> Face-framing is our favorite way to cut layers in hair without sacrificing the length, but a thick, straight mane like this may require additional feathering to gain texture and an airier feel.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>37. Parted Blonde Haircut.</strong> While slicking your locks back isn't a bad idea, shattered strands are more eye-catching on parted hair. The parting creates face-framing pieces that draw attention to your face.</p>
[caption id="attachment_23793" align="aligncenter" width="919"]<img src="https://www.hadviser.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/9-blonde-hair-with-layers-CgUNxdjqqKK.jpg" alt="Soft Layered Hair with Face-Framing Pieces" width="919" height="1225" /> By <a href="https://www.instagram.com/somehair_ali/" target="_blank" >somehair_ali</a>[/caption]

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>38. Mid-Length Shag.</strong> Well, forget blowouts, as edgy shags with such a choppy texture allow us to feather hair in a more blended way, without cutting sharply delineated levels that require definition to shine out.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>39.See-Through Shaggy Bangs.</strong> Shaggy hairstyles do need some texturizing products to show off the texture and movement, but they can be styled fairly messy, similar to this tousled brunette style.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>40. Blonde Rachel Cut.</strong> As is the case with Jennifer Aniston’s iconic coif, this blonde style features a shoulder length, face-framing flick, and lots of layers, but it is cut slightly longer, so the hair feels softer and has more movement.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>41. Shoulder Length Lob.</strong> The beachy vibe that works all year round is perfect for a lob. Use a medium-sized curling iron and wrap your hair around it for about 10 seconds. Style mid-shaft bents rather than full waves or curls.</p>
