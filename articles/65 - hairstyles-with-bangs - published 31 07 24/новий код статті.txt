<p style="text-align: left;">There are plenty of banged hairstyles that won’t disappoint you. No matter how you want to do your hair, there is always a perfect fringe look for you out there. Remember, you want to avoid a blunt cut with a longer face shape and consider a longer side sweep or any other softer style for a more balanced angular jawline. On the flip side, with a rounder face, you want a more elongated fringe that creates face-shaping angles.</p>
