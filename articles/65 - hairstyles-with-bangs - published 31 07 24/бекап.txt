<p style="text-align: left;">There are plenty of hairstyles with bangs that won’t disappoint you. No matter how you want to do your hair, there is always a perfect fringe look for you out there. Remember, you want to avoid <a href="https://www.hadviser.com/blunt-cut/" target="_blank">a blunt cut</a> with a longer face shape and consider a longer side sweep or any other softer style for a more balanced angular jawline. On the flip side, with a rounder face, you want more elongated bangs that create face-shaping angles.</p>
