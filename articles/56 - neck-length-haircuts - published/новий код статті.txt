<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>38. Haircut for Round Faces.</strong> A trick to lift some weight off your face when it appears a little heavier than you’d like is to keep your haircut a bit angled to the front. An asymmetrical stacked cut not only gently brings out your best features, but also flatteringly distributes the volume of your hair.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>39. Choppy Rooty Blonde.</strong> If your hair has enough volume and air on its own, change things up a notch with a soft bronde balayage and a choppy cut. Style it with beachy waves for a look that’s suitable for literally any occasion.</p>
